# [Open Delivery API Specification](https://abrasel-nacional.github.io/docs/)

 
 The present repository defines the OpenAPI 3.0.3 functional specifications for the Open Delivery API.

## Introduction
**Open Delivery** proposes to solve the challenge of organizing the flow of information between merchants and **Ordering Applications**, establishing a single communication standard for all, through a set of REST APIs.
Thus, menus and orders are standardized and customer requests are received in a single place, in an organized and efficient way, allowing the merchant to work with more partners in the delivery environment.
