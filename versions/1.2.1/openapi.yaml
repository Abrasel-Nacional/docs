    # ► ------ OPEN DELIVERY ------ ◄

    # └► Introduction
      **Open Delivery** proposes to solve the challenge of organizing the flow of information between merchants and **Ordering Applications**, establishing a single communication standard for all, through a set of REST APIs.
      Thus, menus and orders are standardized and customer requests are received in a single place, in an organized and efficient way, allowing the merchant to work with more partners in the delivery environment.

    # └► Table Of Contents

      ### Version [1.2.1] - Sep 4, 2023

      #### ORDERS changes

      - [GET /v1/orders/{orderId}](#operation/ordersDetails)

        - Fixed the description of the formula for calculating the final price of an item.  
          
          **NEW Description:**  
              
              (quantity * (unitPrice + optionsPrice))  
            
          _Old description: (quantity * unitPrice + optionsPrice)_  
        
          The new formula includes the value of the item's options when multiplying by the quantity.
        
        - Added the information that the `customer` property should be informed when the order `type` is `DELIVERY`.
        
        - Changed some properties descriptions to better explain their purpose.

      ### Version [1.2.0] - Jul 3, 2023

      We are happy to announce that we are launching the **[Open Delivery Developer Portal](https://developer.opendelivery.com.br)**, along with a fully operational **sandbox environment** for testing the documentation endpoints.

      In this first release, only the **ORDER API** is covered, but all other standards will be available soon.

      We also added a new section **[Sandbox](#section/Sandbox)** in the documentation with info about the sandbox enviroment.

    # 
    # ► ------ GENERAL INFO ------- ◄

    # └► How to Start (Setup Guide)

    The Open Delivery API proposes the implementation of a single communication standard between the various parts that make up the delivery environment. This documentation contains all the definitions needed for interested systems and platforms to implement it.

    Open Delivery does not have a server or baseURL. It is up to each company that implements the standard to use its infrastructure to host the endpoints.

    You can use the **[Sandbox Enviroment](#section/Sandbox)** to test your requests and responses, but there is no Production Enviroment.  
    Once your system or platform is compliant to the standard, you will be able to integrate with other companies also compliant to the standard.

    This section seeks to summarize the Open Delivery documentation as a whole, helping the different parts of the integrations to understand what needs to be developed and parameterized. 

    First, it is recommended to read all the documentation to understand the different processes and flows of the integrations. 

    After reading and understanding the documentation as a whole, companies interested in implementing the standard in their platforms and systems can use this guide to assist in the implementation.

    ## Parties Involved

    - **ORDERING APPLICATION**: It is the platform where the final consumer will choose his items and place the order. It is responsible for reading the merchant data exposed by the SOFTWARE SERVICE and sending the orders to the SOFTWARE SERVICE as well.
              
    - **SOFTWARE SERVICE**: It is the merchant management platform. It is responsible for exposing the merchant data (registration data, service data, and menus) and receiving the orders from the ORDERING APPLICATION.

      > There may also be applications that will perform a hub function, connecting the ORDERING APPLICATION to the SOFTWARE SERVICE. In this context, these intermediate applications, can play the role of both the ORDERING APPLICATION (when communicating with a SOFTWARE SERVICE) as well as the SOFTWARE SERVICE (when communicating with the ORDERING APPLICATION).

    - **LOGISTIC SERVICE**: It is the platform responsible for receiving calls for new deliveries from SOFTWARE SERVICE or ORDERING APPLICATION, and sending the tracking of the deliveries.

    ## Development

    Since Open Delivery is not the host of the APIs, it is up to the companies interested in using the standard to develop the Open Delivery standard APIs in their systems and platforms using this documentation as a guideline. 

    Listed below are the different Routes that each party needs to implement and make available in their systems:

    | |ORDERING APPLICATION|SOFTWARE SERVICE|LOGISTICS SERVICE|

      ## Parametrizations

      > **IMPORTANT: Before reading this section, it is recommended the reading of the complete documentation, for a better understanding of the different required parameterizations.**

      Once the endpoints are implemented, the parties interested in integrating via the Open Delivery stantard should provide some parameters for the other party to correctly connect to its routes. 

      Below is a list of information that each party must provide to the other party for the integrations to occur, i.e., you should consider that the information below will be created as parameters on the system that will call the endpoints.

    ### Orders / Merchant API  

      - **PARAMETERS IN THE SOFTWARE SERVICE   
      (ORDERING APPLICATION --> SOFTWARE SERVICE)**

        - **{baseURL}** : The {baseURL} is the parameter that indicates the base address, i.e. the constant part of the address, where the routes will be called. The **Ordering Application** can provide up to 2 different base URLs:
          - {baseURL} for authentication: where the token route will be hosted.
          - {baseURL} for the other routes.

          The **Ordering Application** can use only one {baseURL} if it wishes.
        
        - **clientId** and **clientSecret**: The **Ordering Application** is responsible for providing the credentials for authentication to be performed through the authentication endpoint. 
        
            > IMPORTANT: As described in the authentication section of the documentation, credentials must be generated BY MERCHANT and not by **Software Service**, that is, even if several MERCHANTS use the same **Software Service**, each of the MERCHANT will have a unique clientId and clientSecret.

        - **AppId**: It is the unique ID of the **Ordering Application**. It must be generated by the **Ordering Application** itself, and once generated, it must be informed to all the **Software Services** that it will integrate. Since the **AppId** is a unique key of the **Ordering Application**, you must not create one **AppId** per **Software Service**, but use the same key for all of them.
        > The companies that play the role of hub, intermediating the integrations between the **Ordering Application** and the **Software Service**, must also generate their own **AppId**, different from the **Ordering Application**'s AppId.

      - **PARAMETERS IN ORDERING APPLICATION  
      (SOFTWARE SERVICE --> ORDERING APPLICATION)**

        - **[GET /merchant](#tag/merchantEndpoints) endpoint URL:** The **Ordering Application** must be provided with the URL to access the `GET /merchant` route to obtain the merchant's information. 

          > IMPORTANT: Each merchant that the **Software Service** works with must have a unique URL.
        - **apiKey**: If the GET /merchant endpoint is implemented using authentication, it is necessary that the **Software Service** provides the apiKey referring to the entered merchant.
        
        - **Order Event Webhook**: If both parties are going to work with sending order events via webhook, it is necessary to provide the URL of the webhook.   
          Default webhook route: 

          `POST {baseURL}/newEvent`

    ### Logistics API    

      - **PARAMETERS IN THE SOFTWARE SERVICE/ORDERING APPLICATION  
      (LOGISTIC SERVICE --> SOFTWARE SERVICE/ORDERING APPLICATION)**

      - **{baseURL}** : The {baseURL} is the parameter that indicates which is the base address, i.e. the constant part of the address, where the routes will be called. The **Logistic Service** can provide up to 2 different base URLs:
          - {baseURL} for authentication: where the token route will be hosted.
          - {baseURL} for the other routes.

          The **Logistic Service** will be able to use only one {baseURL} if it wishes.
        
        - **clientId** and **clientSecret**: The **Logistic Service** is responsible for providing the credentials for authentication to be performed through the authentication endpoint. 
        
            > IMPORTANT: As described in the authentication section of the documentation, the credentials must be generated BY MERCHANT and not by **Software Service**/**Ordering Application**, that is, even if several MERCHANTS use the same **Software Service**/**Ordering Application**, each of the MERCHANT will have a unique clientId and clientSecret.

        - **AppId**: It is a unique identification of the **Logistic Service**. It must be generated by the **Logistic Service** itself and once generated, it must be informed to all the **Software Service** / **Ordering Application** to which it will integrate. As the **AppId** is a unique key of the **Logistic Service**, it must not be created an **AppId** per **Software Service** / **Ordering Application**, but the same key must be informed for all.

      - **PARAMETERS IN THE LOGISTIC SERVICE  
      (SOFTWARE SERVICE/ORDERING APPLICATION --> LOGISTIC SERVICE)**

        - **Tracking Event Webhook**: It is necessary to inform the URL of the webhook to receive the tracking and event updates of the delivery order.   
        Default webhook route:  
        `POST {baseURL}/deliveryEvent`

        - **MerchantId**: It is a unique ID of the MERCHANT. Similar to the **AppId** but for Merchant. It must be generated by the **Software Service** and once generated, it must be informed to all **Logistic Services** it will integrate with. Since the **MerchantId** is a unique key, a **MerchantId** must not be created per **Logistic Service**, but the same key must be informed for all. 
        The **Ordering Application** must send the **MerchantId** received previously through its integration with the **Software Service** or if it does not have it, it can inform any id that it can use to identify the merchant.
        
    # └► Open Delivery API Evolution

      The **Open Delivery** API seeks to respect [SemVer](https://semver.org/). In this sense, compatible changes should not generate a new major version.

      The API version is composed of 4 elements: major, minor, patch and release candidate. The version v[x] in the URL path is the major element of the API version. The evolution of the version is as follows:

      - **Major**: incompatible, contract-breaking changes (v1.0.0 → v2.0.0)
      - **Minor**: compatible, non-breaking changes (v1.1.0 → v1.2.0)
      - **Patch**: bugfixes, clarifications to specifications, no functional changes (v1.1.1 → v1.1.2)
      - **Release candidate**: pre-release versions of any future patch, minor or major (v1.0.0-rc.1 → v1.0.0-rc.22)
      Non-breaking changes and clarifications to specifications may occur at any time. Customers should be prepared to handle these changes without breaking.

      The following changes are expected and considered backward compatible:

      - Addition of new features to the **Open Delivery** API;
      - Addition of new optional parameters;
      - Addition of new fields in **Open Delivery** API responses;
      - Change of fields sorting;
      - Addition of new elements in enumerations.

    # └► General Guidelines

      - **Date-Time, Date and Time values**: For properties that require a Date-Time, Date or Time value, use the formats specified in date-time, date and time formats (following the [RFC3339](https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/public/rfc/html/rfc3339.html#anchor14) specifications)
      
      > **ALL DATES MUST BE SENT USING UTC AS DEFAULT.**   
      > (This way it is simpler for the receiving agent to convert to local time.)

      For example:
      
      **2017-05-01T06:30:00Z** for date-time (As defined by date-time - [RFC3339](https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/public/rfc/html/rfc3339.html#anchor14))\
      **2017-05-01** for date (As defined by full-date - [RFC3339](https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/public/rfc/html/rfc3339.html#anchor14))\
      **08:08:00Z** for time (As defined by full-time - [RFC3339](https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/public/rfc/html/rfc3339.html#anchor14))

    - **IDs**: Use an id property to identify all unique entities within an entity type. An id is a unique identifier of the entity of that type, but across entities, IDs can overlap.

    - **Null** values: Do not use the value null in place of objects. If an object is optional, you must omit it from your feed.

    - **{baseURL}** : Since Open Delivery is not the host of the APIs, it is up to the companies interested in using the standard to provide the {baseURL}. Companies can provide up to two {baseURL}:
        - {baseURL} for authentication: where the **[Get Access Token](#operation/getToken)** route will be hosted.
        - {baseURL} for all other routes.

        > It is also possible to use the same {baseURL} for all routes.

    - **Sending arrays as request parameters:**

      To send an array parameter on a request for any endpoint, use the following format:   
      
      - For `QUERY` parameters:
      ```
      ?param=X&param=Y&param=Z
      ```

      - For `HEADER` parameters:
      ```
          param: X
          param: Y
          param: Z
      ```

    - **Image Files:** For properties that refer to **IMAGES**, two fields are available: `URL` and `CRC-32`
      
      It is expected that the images referenced in the URL are downloaded from the server that is making the request, because the URL may no longer be valid after a period of time.
      
      The CRC-32 field must be used to check if the image has changed since the last time it was received, allowing to verify if a new download is necessary or not.


    # └► Error Handling

      The API returns HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure of requests.

      `2xx` codes indicate success.  
      `4xx` codes indicate failure caused by the information sent by the client or the current state of the entities.  
      `5xx` codes codes indicate service problems on the API side.

    **General**

    This section gathers errors that could be returned by any endpoints listed in the API.

    `BadRequest`

      * __Meaning__: Invalid request.
      * __HTTP Status Code__: [400 Bad Request](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.1).

    `Forbidden`

      * __Meaning__: Authenticated client request that violates some authorization rule.
      * __HTTP Status Code__: [403 Forbidden](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.3).

    `NotFound`

      * __Meaning__: Entity not found.
      * __HTTP Status Code__: [404 Not Found](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.4).


    `InternalServerError`

      * __Meaning__: Unexpected condition when processing requisition.
      * __HTTP Status Code__: [500 Internal Server Error](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.6.1).

    `ServiceUnavailable`

      * __Meaning__: Service is not currently available. Requested service may be under maintenance or outside the operating window.
      * __HTTP Status Code__: [503 Service Unavailable](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.6.4).

    `GatewayTimeout`

      * __Meaning__: Indicates that the service took longer than expected to return.
      * __HTTP Status Code__: [504 Gateway Timeout](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.6.5).

      Because Open Delivery does not have its own servers and relies on the implementation of the endpoints by the platforms of the companies using the standard, it can happen that two platforms are using different versions of the Open Delivery API.

      This section includes endpoints to get the current version that each platform is using.

      The Merchant entity will be the entity used by the **Ordering Application** to fetch all the data from a merchant and display it to the user.
      It is the responsibility of the merchant **Software Service** to provide the endpoint and the responsibility of the **Ordering Application** to fetch the information.

      ## Merchant API Usage

      The merchant must 'choose' a **Software Service**, which will be responsible for exposing its data on the **[GET /v1/merchant](#operation/getMerchant)** endpoint. This endpoint will be used by the ordering system to get the updated merchant infos (BasicInfos, Services and Menus).

      <div align="center">
        <img src="https://abrasel-nacional.github.io/docs/images/menu_flow.png" />
      </div>

      The **Ordering Application** can check for merchant updates in the following ways:    
      1.	Make a new request on the **[GET /v1/merchant](#operation/getMerchant)** endpoint whenever the TTL expires;  
      2.	The **Ordering Application** can optionally provide a **[webhook](#operation/menuUpdated)** , where the merchant **Software Service** can send a merchant update notification;  
      3.	If the **Software Service** **[refuses](#operation/cancelDenied)** an order for any reason, upon receiving the refusal, it is recommended that the **Ordering Application** make a new request on the **[GET /v1/merchant](#operation/getMerchant)** endpoint.

  - name: merchantStructure
    x-displayName: └───● Merchant Structure
    description: |-

      The structure of the Merchant model consists of the following top-level properties:

      - **BasicInfo**: Information about the merchant.
      - **Services entities**: Timing, location, and conditions of the merchant service.
      - **Menu entities**: Details of the merchnat menus.

      The following diagram shows how Basic Info, Service, and Menu properties represent a single merchant:

      <div align="center">
        <img src="https://abrasel-nacional.github.io/docs/images/merchant_structure.png" />
      </div>

      The following schema lists the properties for the `Merchant` model:

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/MerchantDescription" />     

      # BasicInfo

      A merchant `BasicInfo` defines properties such as the merchant name, location address, website, description, telephone number, for a merchant that the merchant **Software Service** serves. 
      Typically, this data is static.

      The following schema lists the properties for the `BasicInfo` type: 

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/BasicInfo" />

      # Service

      The `Service` defines the capabilities of a delivery organization in a geographic region.
      A `Service` defines properties such as the service type (`DELIVERY` or `TAKEOUT`), hours available, and area served.  
      Each Service must be linked to a `Menu`, through the `menuId` property.   
      `Service` is expected to change.

      <div align="center">
        <img src="https://abrasel-nacional.github.io/docs/images/merchant_services.png" />
      </div>

      The following schema lists the properties for the `Service` type: 

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Service" />

      # Menu

      A `Menu` is a set of linked properties such as categories, items, offers and availability.  
      In order to be displayed by the **Ordering Application**, a `Menu` needs to be linked to a `Service` through the `menuId` property.

      <div align="center">
        <img src="https://abrasel-nacional.github.io/docs/images/merchant_menus.png" />
      </div>

      Data in a `Menu` entity is expected to change.

      The following schema lists the properties for the `Menu` type: 

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Menu" />

      ## Category

      A `Category` is the propertie in which the merchant has to organize its `ItemsOffers` in order 
      to make it easier for the user to find what he wants to buy. Categories have statuses and accepts `Availability` entities.

      The following schema lists the properties for the `Category` type: 

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Category" />

      ## Item

      A `Item` propertie is the menu entity that carries all the general item information, like:
      name, description, external code, image, nutricional information, and EAN (European Article Number).
      The `Item` can be offered in a `Menu` as a main item or an option. And, for the same store, it can even be reused in different `Menus`.

      The following schema lists the properties for the `Item` type: 

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Item" />

      ## ItemOffer

      The `ItemOffer` can be considered the offering of a item, and it is used to set the item price and `Availability`.
      The `ItemOffer` is a `Item` related to the `Category`.

      The following schema lists the properties for the `ItemOffer` type: 

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/ItemOffer" />

      ## OptionGroup and Option

      The `OptionGroup` is the entity used to group customizations of a product, for example: "Choose your beverage:"
      An `OptionGroup` can be shared by several items.
      The `OptionGroup` has its own statuses, and can be activated or desactivated when needed. 

      `Options` are the complements of a OptionGroup. It can be defined as: "A `Item` related to a `OptionGroup`". 
      It is possible to set the `Option` price to 0.00 regardless of whether it is mandatory or optional.

      The following schema lists the properties for the `OptionGroup` type: 

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/OptionGroup" />


      ## Availability

      The `Availability` entity defines specific times and days to control the availability of `Categories` and `Item offerings` within the `Menu`.
      It is also possible to set special times for holidays.

      The following schema lists the properties for the `Availability` type: 

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Availability" />

  - name: merchantEndpoints

      This section details the `GET /v1/merchant` endpoint.

      This endpoint should be implemented by the `Software Service` and its URL should be informed to the `Ordering Application`.

      The endpoint is designed so that **each merchant has its own URL**.  

      The specification recommends that the endpoint ends with the `/merchant` route, but this is **not mandatory**. The `Software Service` can implement the URL in any way it sees fit, as long as it contains information from **only one** merchant.

      ### Merchant Update Notification

      **[Webhook](#operation/menuUpdated)** is sent to notify the **Ordering Application** that an new update has happened on the merchant information.

      The **Ordering Application** that implements this webhook, should return an HTTP 200 response code with an empty response body to acknowledge receipt of the webhook event. 
      If the merchant **Software Service** does not receive a 200 acknowledgement response, than the webhook event will be resent based on the **Software Service** policies.

  - name: ordersOverview
    x-displayName: └───● Order Overview
    description: |-

      This overview summarizes the **Open Delivery** Ordering flow and how it interacts with merchant **Software Service** and **Ordering Application**.


      ### Order Events

      <div align="center">
        <img src="https://abrasel-nacional.github.io/docs/images/order_life_cicle.png" />
        <br />
        <br />

      ### Understanding the Order Flow

      <div align="center">
        <img src="https://abrasel-nacional.github.io/docs/images/order_integrations2.png" />
      </div>

      The order flow has the following Macro steps:

      ### Order Event Reception

      Through Order Events, the '**Ordering Application**' communicates to the '**Software Service**' the existence of a new order, as well as the other events of the order lifecycle.

      **Open Delivery** provides two ways for merchant **Software Service** to be aware of new events:

      - **[Polling](#tag/ordersPolling)**: 
      Receiving events through polling provided by the '**Ordering Application**' is the standard way **Open Delivery** works, and its implementation is mandatory.

      - **[Webhook](#tag/ordersWebhook)**:
        Optionally it is recommended the implementation of a **webhook** by the merchant **Software Service** for the **Ordering Applications** to send new events directly, ensuring a much faster communication.

        > As this implementation is not mandatory, it is recommended that the merchant **Software Service** contacts the **Ordering Application** to find out if it is possible to work with this possibility.

      ### Order Details

      Once the new order event is received, it is necessary to get the **[order details](#tag/ordersDetails)**, such as items purchased, delivery addresses, and payment methods.

      ### Events Updates

      After getting the order details, the merchant needs to notify the '**Ordering Application**' of the order progress.

      Through the **Open Delivery** API it is possible to:

      - **[Confirm](#operation/confirmOrder)** receipt of order;
      - Notify that an order is **[ready for pickup](#operation/orderReady)**;
      - Notify that an order has been **[dispatched](#operation/dispatchOrder)**.

      Whenever a merchant triggers one of these actions, the '**Ordering Application**' will send a new event to the mechart **Software Service**, acknowledging the new order status within the '**Ordering Application**'.

      > For `TAKEOUT` orders, it is possible to optionally assign a **pickup area** that will be informed through an event to the merchant.
      > This must be provided by the **Ordering Application** interface.

      ### Order Cancellation

      **Open Delivery** provides API's to send **[cancellation](#tag/ordersCancellation)** requests from either system.
      These requests can be accepted or denied depending on the rules that the company has.
    x-traitTag: true

  - name: ordersPolling
    x-displayName: └───● Polling
    description: |-

      Receiving events via Polling works as follows:

      <div align="center">
        <img src="https://abrasel-nacional.github.io/docs/images/polling.png" />
      </div>

      ### Query new order events

      In order to receive new order events, the merchant **Software Service** must make requests on the polling endpoint regularly at a certain time interval, determined by the '**Ordering Application**'. 
      Whenever there is a new event the response will send the response code 200 with the list of events. If there are no new events, the response will send the response code 204.

      > It is important that the **Software Service** performs the requests within the timeframe determined by the **Ordering Application**, as blocking and penalties may occur depending on the application's rules.

      **Availability of new events in polling:** 

      The **Ordering Application** may have specific rules about the maximum time new events are available in polling before they are removed.
          
      > Always check with the **Ordering Application** what the rules are for using the polling service. 

      **Duplicate Events**

      Eventually the **Ordering Application** may return the same event more than once, for example the `CREATED` event, including old orders. For this reason it is important that the **Software Application** handles the uniqueness of requests and events through id and the date.

      Therefore, when receiving an event, the **Software Service** must check the event id and validate that this event (id) has not been processed before. If this event has already been received previously, it must be discarded.

      > **Please note**: merchant **Software Services** should only accept a new order or update the status of an order after validating that the event has not been processed before.

      It is also possible for the **Software Service** to make a request for the same event more than once (for example, requesting the `POST /v1/orders/{orderId}/confirm` endpoint repeatedly).

      In these cases the **Ordering Application** can handle this situation in two different ways:

        - If the processing of the requests is done synchronously, then the **Ordering Application** should return **`HTTP 422`**, indicating that that event has been received before.

        - If the processing is done asynchronously, then it is recommended that the **Ordering Application** polls the corresponding event again, because for some reason the **Software Service** could not read that event before.
            
      ### Acknowledgment Events

      When receiving new events, the **Software Service** should always send acknowledgement so that the **Ordering Application** does not send that same event again;

      >**Important recommendations**:
      >
      > Merchants **Software Service** should make an acknowledgment request for each polling request with results.  
      > If it receives events that are not used by the itself, it needs to send the acknowledgment of these events anyway so that it is not receiving them every polling again.   
      > **Open Delivery** recommends that this be the default treatment for all events not yet mapped in the **Software Service** application.  
      > **Software Services** only needs to send acknowledgment of the event once."

  - name: ordersWebhook
    x-displayName: └───● Webhook
    description: |-

      Receiving events via Webhook works as follows:

      <div align="center">
        <img src="https://abrasel-nacional.github.io/docs/images/webhook.png" />
      </div>

      ### Order Event Notification
      Webhook is sent to notify the merchant **Software Service** that an new order event has happened on the **Ordering Application**.

      The merchant **Software Service** that implements this webhook, should return an HTTP `200` response code with an empty response body to acknowledge receipt of the webhook event. 
      If the **Ordering Application** does not receive a `200` acknowledgement response, than the webhook event will be resent based on the **Ordering Application** policies.

      ### Webhook Headers
      **Open Delivery** will include security headers for all requests made to the merchant **Software Service** webhook URL.

      **Header Description**

      | Header            | Description |
      | ----------------- | ----------- |
      | X-App-Id          | An Unique Identificator of the **Ordering Application** |
      | X-App-MerchantId   | An Unique Identificator of the **Merchant** receiving the order |      
      | X-App-Signature   | SHA256 hash of the request body, using the client secret as the key |

        
      **Webhook Security** 

      Webhook messages are signed so that the merchant **Software Service** can verify that the sender is a valid **Ordering Application**. 
      Webhooks requests contain an X-App-Signature header. 
      The value of this field is a lowercased hexadecimal HMAC signature of the webhook HTTP request body, using the client secret as a key and SHA256 as the hash function.

  - name: ordersDetails
    x-displayName: └───● Order Details
    description: |-

      Before confirming or canceling an order, it is necessary to get the order details so that the merchant **Software Service** user can check if he will be able to prepare and deliver this order, such as checking if he has all the necessary items and if he is available to make the delivery to the informed address.

      Through the GET /orders/{id} endpoint the merchant **Software Service** can get all the details of an order.

      This endpoint returns the code 200 and the content of the request. If an invalid request id or the id of an expired order is entered (depending on the **Ordering Application** policy) the endpoint returns 404.

      In this section you will find all the details of the payload of an order:

      <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Order" />

  - name: ordersStatus
    x-displayName: └───● Order Event Updates
    description: |-

      Following the order lifecycle, the merchant **Software Service** needs to notify the **Ordering Application** of the upcoming order status.

      After acknowledging receipt of a new order event (either via polling or webhook) is expected that the **Software Service** explicitly 
      **POST [/orders/{orderId}/confirm](#operation/confirmOrder)** or **POST [/orders/{orderId}/requestCancellation](#operation/requestCancellation)** within a time window set by the **Ordering Application**.
      Otherwise the order can time out and auto-cancel and the merchant can suffer a penalty based on the **Ordering Application** policy.   
      Order acceptances should be posted as quickly as possible to minimize consumer cancellations.

      When the order is ready, it is expected that a request will be sent to **[/orders/{orderId}/readyForPickup](#operation/orderReady)**

      When the order goes out for Delivery, it is expected that a request will be sent to **[/orders/{orderId}/dispatch](#operation/dispatchOrder)**.

      > When sending requests to these endpoints, is expected that the **Ordering Application** notifies the consumer of the progress of the order.

  - name: ordersCancellation
    x-displayName: └───● Order Cancellation
    description: |-

      An order can be canceled for several reasons and the initiative to cancel an order can come from the merchant, the customer, or the **Ordering Application**.   
      It may also happen that the delivery person requests the cancellation in some scenarios, such as when the customer is not found at the delivery address.

      > **Cancellation Rules**
      >  
      > It is expected that both the **Ordering Application** and merchant **Software Service** have their own order cancellation policies and inform their users.

      A cancellation request will always be an asynchronous processing, where one party makes a cancellation request and the other accepts or refuses it."

      A cancellation request must always contain:

      - **reason**: Open text field indicating the reason for the cancellation.
      - **code**: An enumerator containing a cancellation reason.  
      - **mode**: Field indicating whether the cancellation occurred Automatically or Manually.

      The cancellation can be requested by:

      ### **Software Service** (Merchant):

      <div align="center">
        <img src="https://abrasel-nacional.github.io/docs/images/software_cancel_request.png" />
      </div>

      If the merchant wants to cancel an order, it must make a **POST [/orders/{orderId}/requestCancellation](#operation/requestCancellation)** request.

      > **Penalties**
      >
      > Avoid order cancellations! Excessive cancellations can result in some penalties (depending on the **Ordering Application**'s** policy) such as having the merchant temporarily closed on the platform.

      **Cancellation Validation**

      The Cancellation request does not guarantee that the order is cancelled. When sending a request [/orders/{orderId}/requestCancellation](#operation/requestCancellation), the **Ordering Application** will send the code 202 (accepted) in response.
      This does not yet mean that the request has been cancelled. It means that the request has been accepted and will be processed by the **Ordering Application** cancellation service. As a result of this request, the merchant **Software Service** may receive at the next polling (or via webhook) one of the following events:

      - CANCELLATION_REQUEST_DENIED
      - CANCELLED

      The order should only be Canceled when the CANCELLED event is generated.

      > Cancellation rules may vary depending on the timing of the order (before or after confirmation). In some situations it is possible that the **Ordering Application** cancellation service will consult with the consumer on whether or not the consumer accepts the cancellation of the order.

      ``` 
      Cancellation codes:

      - SYSTEMIC_ISSUES
      - DUPLICATE_APPLICATION
      - UNAVAILABLE_ITEM
      - RESTAURANT_WITHOUT_DELIVERY_MAN
      - OUTDATED_MENU
      - ORDER_OUTSIDE_THE_DELIVERY_AREA
      - BLOCKED_CUSTOMER
      - OUTSIDE_DELIVERY_HOURS
      - INTERNAL_DIFFICULTIES_OF_THE_RESTAURANT
      - RISK_AREA
      - DELIVERY_PROBLEM
      ``` 

      > **Important**: It is recommended that the **Ordering Application** makes a new request on the [GET /v1/merchant](#operation/getMerchant) endpoint whenever a merchant makes a Cancellation request.

      ### **Ordering Application**

      <div align="center">
        <img src="https://abrasel-nacional.github.io/docs/images/orderingApp_cancel_request.png" />
      </div>

      Cancellation by **Ordering Application** can happen by:
      ```
      code: CONSUMER_CANCELLATION_REQUESTED
      ```  

      The consumer can request the cancellation of an order. 
      Depending on the cancellation rules applied, this option may not be enabled for all merchants. 
      It may also only be allowed at certain times, such as before the order is confirmed.
      ```
      code: OTHER_CANCELLATION_REASON
      ```

      Ordering Aplications may cancel the order for reasons other than via customer.

      **Cancellation Handshake**

      When the request occurs the merchant **Software Service** will receive an ORDER_CANCELLATION_REQUESTED event in polling (or via webhook) and must manifest itself through the following endpoints:

      **[/orders/{orderId}/acceptCancellation](#operation/cancellationAccepted)**  
      **[/orders/{orderId}/denyCancellation](#operation/cancellationDenied)**

      This request will be processed by the **Ordering Application**'s** cancellation service (asynchronously) and the merchant **Software Service** will receive in the next polling (or webhook) the following event(s):

      CANCELLATION_DENIED or CANCELLED

    x-displayName: └───● Logistic Overview
    description: |-
      Open Delivery provides a set of standards so that both merchants through their **Software Services** and **Ordering Applications** can request a new delivery to a logistics operator and track this delivery.

      ## Logistics API Usage

      Open Delivery's Logistic API aims to standardize the communication between a **requester** - which can be either a **Software Service** or an **Ordering Application** - and a company's software that provides **Logistic Services** (called here **Logistic Service**).  

      > A **Logistic Service** can be either a company that specializes in delivery services or an **Ordering Application** that also provides delivery services. 

      > The Open Delivery logistics API only handles communications between the merchant software (or **Ordering Application**) and the software of the logistics operator. Communications and interfaces with the deliverers at the end are not covered in this documentation, leaving it up to the logistics companies to perform this interaction.

      <div align="center">
        <img src="https://abrasel-nacional.github.io/docs/images/logisticsFlow.png" />
      </div>

      The endpoints provided here, cover the following functionalities:

      ### Delivery Order

      It covers the calling of a new delivery, as well as auxiliary endpoints for reporting the pickup of an order, the completion of the delivery, as well as problem handling and cancellations.

      ### Delivery Tracking
      Webhook to be available at the **requester's** side of the call, in order to receive all order event updates, as well as delivery information updates.

      ### Delivery Availability and Price

      Endpoint with the function of simulating a new delivery, with the purpose of checking if it is possible to make the delivery as well as its prices and times. "

  - name: logisticOrder
    x-displayName: └───● Delivery Order
    description: |-

      ### Events

      This overview summarizes the **Open Delivery** delivery ordering flow and how it interacts with the requester (merchant **Software Services** or **Ordering Applications**) and the **Logistic Services**.

      <div align="center">
        <img src="https://abrasel-nacional.github.io/docs/images/logisticsOrderFlow.png" />
      </div>

      > The `PICKUP_ONGOING`, `DELIVERY_ONGOING` and `RETURNING_TO_MERCHANT` events are events that occur while the delivery person is on the move, so these events can be sent repeatedly in order to update the delivery person's location. The interval at which these events are sent is defined by each **Logistic Service**. 

      > It is important to emphasize that the entire event flow is per Order and even though a delivery may have combined orders (see section below), for all operations in the flow, the id to be used is the `orderId` (initially informed by the requester at the /logistics/delivery endpoint). 

       ### Combining Orders

      The Open Delivery logistics API offers the option of combining more than one order into a single delivery.  
      This can be done on both the **Software Service** (or **Ordering Application**) and the **Logistic Service** sides.

      To combine orders its necessary that at least one delivery is currently in progress.
      When requesting for a new delivery, you need to inform the `deliveryId` field of the ongoing delivery in the `combinedDeliveryId` field of the new request.

      <div align="center">
        <img src="https://abrasel-nacional.github.io/docs/images/logisticsCombined.png" />
      </div>

      > This combination will be subject to acceptance by the **Logistic Service**. 

      The **Logistic Service** may also perform order combination in its software, using its algorithms and processes (provided that the `canCombine` field is entered as `TRUE` in the delivery request). 
      > For this combination no action is required from the **requester**.

      Regardless of the case, the **Logistic Service** must inform in the event webhook the combined orders of the same merchant, through the `combinedOrdersIds` field.


      > Since all event flow is per Order, then in the case of deliveries that have combined orders, an event message must be sent to each of the orders separately. 

      ### Order Rejection and retries for the same order

      If a new delivery order is rejected by the **Logistic Service**, regardless of the reason, the **Software Service** / **Ordering Application** can make a new attempt for the same order (same `orderId` and same `orderDisplayId`). The **Logistic Service** must receive this retry only if the last sent event for this order was the `REJECTED` event. If any other event has already been sent, then the **Logistic Service** will return a duplicate orderId error.

      > The number of retries possible for the same order is defined by each **Logistic Service**.

       </div>

       ### Delivery Order Event Notification
       Webhook is sent to notify the merchant **Software Service** (or the **Ordering Application**) that an new order event has happened on the **Logistic Service**.

       The host that implements this webhook, should return an HTTP `200` response code with an empty response body to acknowledge receipt of the webhook event. 
       If the **Logistic Service** does not receive a `200` acknowledgement response, than the webhook event will be resent based on the **Logistic Service** policies.

       ### Webhook Headers
       **Open Delivery** will include security headers for all requests made to the merchant **Software Service** webhook URL.

       **Header Description**

       | Header            | Description |
       | ----------------- | ----------- |

       **Webhook Security** 

       Webhook messages are signed so that the merchant **Software Service** (or the **Ordering Application**) can verify that the sender is a valid **Logistic Service**. 
       Webhooks requests contain an X-App-Signature header. 
       The value of this field is a lowercased hexadecimal HMAC signature of the webhook HTTP request body, using the client secret as a key and SHA256 as the hash function.

    x-displayName: └───● Delivery Availability and Pricing
    description: |-

      Endpoint used to check the availability of a **`Logistic Service`** to make a delivery with addresses and times already defined, as well as to obtain the price for this delivery.

      This endpoint only simulates the acceptance of a new delivery request, using the information available at the time of the call. 

      > The call to this endpoint does not generate any commitment to **Logistic Service** and should only be used as an estimate of the delivery values.  
        To make a real delivery request, call this endpoint.

  - name: logisticDetails
    x-displayName: └───● Delivery Details and History
    description: |-

      Endpoint used to get detailed and history information for a specific delivery order. 

      > This endpoint should not be used as a way to get delivery tracking. This is already covered in the events webhook. The purpose of this route is to receive sporadic calls to get missing information or the complete history of events and problems.
        Misuse of this endpoint can result in blockages by **Logistic Service**.

        It is important that the **Logistic Service** always informs the **Software Service** (or **Ordering Application**) of a problem (via webhook), even if the problem does not require any action by the merchant to solve it.

        > Since there are other ways to solve delivery problems, such as via telephone or messaging applications, the implementation of this endpoint is optional, and the **Logistic Service** will inform the **Software Service** (or **Ordering Application**) of the need to use it.

        Information about a update in the systems.

        This endpoint can be used in the following ways:

        **1 - Sent with an empty body:**  
        This will force **Ordering Application** to make a new request to the **[GET /v1/merchant](#operation/getMerchant)** endpoint to update all the **merchant** information.

        **2 - Sent with only the `merchantStatus` field:**  
        This will force the opening or closing of the **merchant** within the **Ordering Application**, without forcing a new **[GET /v1/merchant](#operation/getMerchant)** call.

        **3 - Sent only with the `entityType` and `updatedObjects` fields:**  
        This will force the **Ordering Application** to update only the sent objects, without forcing a new **[GET /v1/merchant](#operation/getMerchant)** call.
        > When the `entityType` field is populated, the `updatedObjects` field cannot be empty.

        **4 - Sent the `merchantStatus`, `entityType` and `updatedObjects` fields:**  
        This will force scenarios 2 and 3 to happen simultaneously.

        As of the time of this release only one scope will be used for all endpoints: `od.all`.

        ### Generating a Client Credentials Token

        To generate a client credentials token, the merchant **Software Service** must retrieve the **clientId** and **clientSecret** from a **Ordering Application** Company and access the [/oauth/token](#operation/getToken) endpoint.

        > The **Ordering Application** MUST provide one `clientId` and `clientSecret` credentials for each individual merchant it will work with, even if these merchants use the same **Software Service**.

        ### Usage

        The **accessToken** field will contain the token used to authenticate against the **Open Delivery** APIs. Once you’ve obtained this token, you can provide it in the “Authorization” header of requests you make to endpoints that require client credentials scopes.

        The **expiresIn** field indicates the lifetime of the access token, provided in seconds. This should be cached and re-used across requests until (or shortly before) expiration, not re-generated per request.

        ```

        curl \n
        -H 'authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' \n
