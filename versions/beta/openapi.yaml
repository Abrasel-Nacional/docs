    # └► 'BETA' VERSION WARNING

    > **THIS DOCUMENTATION VERSION CONTAINS INFORMATION THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN OFFICIALLY RELEASED AND IS STILL IN BETA STAGE. THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HERE IS STILL UNDERGOING TESTING AND VALIDATION AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO CHANGE (SEE THE [CHANGELOGS](#section/Table-Of-Contents) SECTION FOR THE LATEST CHANGES).**

    # └► Introduction
      **Open Delivery** proposes to solve the challenge of organizing the flow of information between merchants and **Ordering Applications**, establishing a single communication standard for all, through a set of REST APIs.
      Thus, menus and orders are standardized and customer requests are received in a single place, in an organized and efficient way, allowing the merchant to work with more partners in the delivery environment.

    # └► Table Of Contents

    The documentation is separated as follows:

    **[General and Common Information](#section/-GENERAL-INFO-)**    
    This is information that is valid for all versions that exist so far.

    # 
    # ► ------- GENERAL INFO -------- ◄

    # └► General Guidelines

     - **Date-Time, Date and Time values**: For properties that require a Date-Time, Date or Time value, use the formats specified in date-time, date and time formats (following the [RFC3339](https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/public/rfc/html/rfc3339.html#anchor14) specifications)
      
      > **ALL DATES MUST BE SENT USING UTC AS DEFAULT.**   
      > (This way it is simpler for the receiving agent to convert to local time.)

      For example:
      
      **2017-05-01T06:30:00Z** for date-time (As defined by date-time - [RFC3339](https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/public/rfc/html/rfc3339.html#anchor14))\
      **2017-05-01** for date (As defined by full-date - [RFC3339](https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/public/rfc/html/rfc3339.html#anchor14))\
      **08:08:00Z** for time (As defined by full-time - [RFC3339](https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/public/rfc/html/rfc3339.html#anchor14))

    - **IDs**: Use an id property to identify all unique entities within an entity type. An id is a unique identifier of the entity of that type, but across entities, IDs can overlap.

    - **Null** values: Do not use the value null in place of objects. If an object is optional, you must omit it from your feed.

    - **{baseURL}** : Since Open Delivery is not the host of the APIs, it is up to the companies interested in using the standard to provide the {baseURL}. Companies can provide up to two {baseURL}:
        - {baseURL} for authentication: where the **[Get Access Token](#operation/getToken)** route will be hosted.
        - {baseURL} for all other routes.

        > It is also possible to use the same {baseURL} for all routes.

    - **Sending arrays as request parameters:**

      To send an array parameter on a request for any endpoint, use the following format:   
      
      - For `QUERY` parameters:
      ```
      ?param=X&param=Y&param=Z
      ```

      - For `HEADER` parameters:
      ```
          param: X
          param: Y
          param: Z
      ```



    # └► Error Handling

     The API returns HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure of requests.

     `2xx` codes indicate success.  
     `4xx` codes indicate failure caused by the information sent by the client or the current state of the entities.  
     `5xx` codes codes indicate service problems on the API side.

    **General**

    This section gathers errors that could be returned by any endpoints listed in the API.

    `BadRequest`

      * __Meaning__: Invalid request.
      * __HTTP Status Code__: [400 Bad Request](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.1).

      * __Meaning__: Authenticated client request that violates some authorization rule.
      * __HTTP Status Code__: [403 Forbidden](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.3).

    `NotFound`

      * __Meaning__: Entity not found.
      * __HTTP Status Code__: [404 Not Found](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.4).


    `InternalServerError`

      * __Meaning__: Unexpected condition when processing requisition.
      * __HTTP Status Code__: [500 Internal Server Error](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.6.1).

      * __HTTP Status Code__: [503 Service Unavailable](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.6.4).

    `GatewayTimeout`

      * __Meaning__: Indicates that the service took longer than expected to return.
      * __HTTP Status Code__: [504 Gateway Timeout](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.6.5).

  #     Because Open Delivery does not have its own servers and relies on the implementation of the endpoints by the platforms of the companies using the standard, it can happen that two platforms are using different versions of the Open Delivery API.

  #     This section includes endpoints to get the current version that each platform is using.

  #     The Merchant entity will be the entity used by the **Ordering Application** to fetch all the data from a merchant and display it to the user.
  #     It is the responsibility of the merchant **Software Service** to provide the endpoint and the responsibility of the **Ordering Application** to fetch the information.

  #     ## Merchant API Usage

  #     The merchant must 'choose' a **Software Service**, which will be responsible for exposing its data on the **[GET /v1/merchant](#operation/getMerchant)** endpoint. This endpoint will be used by the ordering system to get the updated merchant infos (BasicInfos, Services and Menus).

  #     <div align="center">
  #       <img src="https://abrasel-nacional.github.io/docs/images/menu_flow.png" />
  #     </div>

  #     The **Ordering Application** can check for merchant updates in the following ways:    
  #     1.	Make a new request on the **[GET /v1/merchant](#operation/getMerchant)** endpoint whenever the TTL expires;  
  #     2.	The **Ordering Application** can optionally provide a **[webhook](#operation/menuUpdated)** , where the merchant **Software Service** can send a merchant update notification;  
  #     3.	If the **Software Service** **[refuses](#operation/cancelDenied)** an order for any reason, upon receiving the refusal, it is recommended that the **Ordering Application** make a new request on the **[GET /v1/merchant](#operation/getMerchant)** endpoint.

  # - name: merchantStructure
  #   x-displayName: └───● Merchant Structure
  #   description: |-

  #     The structure of the Merchant model consists of the following top-level properties:

  #     - **BasicInfo**: Information about the merchant.
  #     - **Services entities**: Timing, location, and conditions of the merchant service.
  #     - **Menu entities**: Details of the merchnat menus.

  #     The following diagram shows how Basic Info, Service, and Menu properties represent a single merchant:

  #     <div align="center">
  #       <img src="https://abrasel-nacional.github.io/docs/images/merchant_structure.png" />
  #     </div>

  #     The following schema lists the properties for the `Merchant` model:

  #     <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/MerchantDescription" />     

  #     # BasicInfo

  #     A merchant `BasicInfo` defines properties such as the merchant name, location address, website, description, telephone number, for a merchant that the merchant **Software Service** serves. 
  #     Typically, this data is static.

  #     The following schema lists the properties for the `BasicInfo` type: 

  #     <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/BasicInfo" />

  #     # Service

  #     The `Service` defines the capabilities of a delivery organization in a geographic region.
  #     A `Service` defines properties such as the service type (`DELIVERY` or `TAKEOUT`), hours available, and area served.  
  #     Each Service must be linked to a `Menu`, through the `menuId` property.   
  #     `Service` is expected to change.

  #     <div align="center">
  #       <img src="https://abrasel-nacional.github.io/docs/images/merchant_services.png" />
  #     </div>

  #     The following schema lists the properties for the `Service` type: 

  #     <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Service" />

  #     # Menu

  #     A `Menu` is a set of linked properties such as categories, items, offers and availability.  
  #     In order to be displayed by the **Ordering Application**, a `Menu` needs to be linked to a `Service` through the `menuId` property.

  #     <div align="center">
  #       <img src="https://abrasel-nacional.github.io/docs/images/merchant_menus.png" />
  #     </div>

  #     Data in a `Menu` entity is expected to change.

  #     The following schema lists the properties for the `Menu` type: 

  #     <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Menu" />

  #     ## Category

  #     A `Category` is the propertie in which the merchant has to organize its `ItemsOffers` in order 
  #     to make it easier for the user to find what he wants to buy. Categories have statuses and accepts `Availability` entities.

  #     The following schema lists the properties for the `Category` type: 

  #     <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Category" />

  #     ## Item

  #     A `Item` propertie is the menu entity that carries all the general item information, like:
  #     name, description, external code, image, nutricional information, and EAN (European Article Number).
  #     The `Item` can be offered in a `Menu` as a main item or an option. And, for the same store, it can even be reused in different `Menus`.

  #     The following schema lists the properties for the `Item` type: 

  #     <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Item" />

  #     ## ItemOffer

  #     The `ItemOffer` can be considered the offering of a item, and it is used to set the item price and `Availability`.
  #     The `ItemOffer` is a `Item` related to the `Category`.

  #     The following schema lists the properties for the `ItemOffer` type: 

  #     <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/ItemOffer" />

  #     ## OptionGroup and Option

  #     The `OptionGroup` is the entity used to group customizations of a product, for example: "Choose your beverage:"
  #     An `OptionGroup` can be shared by several items.
  #     The `OptionGroup` has its own statuses, and can be activated or desactivated when needed. 

  #     `Options` are the complements of a OptionGroup. It can be defined as: "A `Item` related to a `OptionGroup`". 
  #     It is possible to set the `Option` price to 0.00 regardless of whether it is mandatory or optional.

  #     The following schema lists the properties for the `OptionGroup` type: 

  #     <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/OptionGroup" />


  #     ## Availability

  #     The `Availability` entity defines specific times and days to control the availability of `Categories` and `Item offerings` within the `Menu`.
  #     It is also possible to set special times for holidays.

  #     The following schema lists the properties for the `Availability` type:

  #     ### Merchant Update Notification

  #     **[Webhook](#operation/menuUpdated)** is sent to notify the **Ordering Application** that an new update has happened on the merchant information.

  #     The **Ordering Application** that implements this webhook, should return an HTTP 200 response code with an empty response body to acknowledge receipt of the webhook event. 
  #     If the merchant **Software Service** does not receive a 200 acknowledgement response, than the webhook event will be resent based on the **Software Service** policies.

  #   description: |-

  #     This overview summarizes the **Open Delivery** Ordering flow and how it interacts with merchant **Software Service** and **Ordering Application**.

  #     ### Order Events

  #     <div align="center">
  #       <img src="https://abrasel-nacional.github.io/docs/images/order_life_cicle.png" />
  #       <br />
  #       <br />
  #       <br />
  #       <br />
  #       <br />
  #     </div>

  #     ### Understanding the Order Flow

  #     <div align="center">
  #       <img src="https://abrasel-nacional.github.io/docs/images/order_integrations2.png" />
  #     </div>

  #     The order flow has the following Macro steps:

  #     ### Order Event Reception

  #     Through Order Events, the '**Ordering Application**' communicates to the '**Software Service**' the existence of a new order, as well as the other events of the order lifecycle.

  #     **Open Delivery** provides two ways for merchant **Software Service** to be aware of new events:

  #     - **[Polling](#tag/ordersPolling)**: 
  #     Receiving events through polling provided by the '**Ordering Application**' is the standard way **Open Delivery** works, and its implementation is mandatory.

  #     - **[Webhook](#tag/ordersWebhook)**:
  #       Optionally it is recommended the implementation of a **webhook** by the merchant **Software Service** for the **Ordering Applications** to send new events directly, ensuring a much faster communication.

  #       > As this implementation is not mandatory, it is recommended that the merchant **Software Service** contacts the **Ordering Application** to find out if it is possible to work with this possibility.

  #     ### Order Details

  #     Once the new order event is received, it is necessary to get the **[order details](#tag/ordersDetails)**, such as items purchased, delivery addresses, and payment methods.

  #     ### Events Updates

  #     After getting the order details, the merchant needs to notify the '**Ordering Application**' of the order progress.

  #     Through the **Open Delivery** API it is possible to:

  #     - **[Confirm](#operation/confirmOrder)** receipt of order;
  #     - Notify that an order is **[ready for pickup](#operation/orderReady)**;
  #     - Notify that an order has been **[dispatched](#operation/dispatchOrder)**.

  #     Whenever a merchant triggers one of these actions, the '**Ordering Application**' will send a new event to the mechart **Software Service**, acknowledging the new order status within the '**Ordering Application**'.

  #     > For `TAKEOUT` orders, it is possible to optionally assign a **pickup area** that will be informed through an event to the merchant.
  #     > This must be provided by the **Ordering Application** interface.

  #     ### Order Cancellation

  #     **Open Delivery** provides API's to send **[cancellation](#tag/ordersCancellation)** requests from either system.
  #     These requests can be accepted or denied depending on the rules that the company has.
  #   x-traitTag: true

  # - name: ordersPolling
  #   x-displayName: └───● Polling (Required)
  #   description: |-

  #     Receiving events via Polling works as follows:

  #     <div align="center">
  #       <img src="https://abrasel-nacional.github.io/docs/images/polling.png" />
  #     </div>

  #     ### Query new order events

  #     In order to receive new order events, the merchant **Software Service** must make requests on the polling endpoint regularly at a certain time interval, determined by the '**Ordering Application**'. 
  #     Whenever there is a new event the response will send the response code 200 with the list of events. If there are no new events, the response will send the response code 204.

  #     > It is important that the **Software Service** performs the requests within the timeframe determined by the **Ordering Application**, as blocking and penalties may occur depending on the application's rules.

  #     **Availability of new events in polling:** 

  #     The **Ordering Application** may have specific rules about the maximum time new events are available in polling before they are removed.
          
  #     > Always check with the **Ordering Application** what the rules are for using the polling service. 

  #     **Duplicate Events and Order Date:**

  #     Eventually the API may return the same event more than once, for example the PLACED event including old orders. For this reason it is important that your application handles the uniqueness of requests and events through id and the date through "createdAt".

  #     Therefore, when receiving an event, you must check the event id and validate that this event (id) has not been processed before. If this event has already been received previously, it must be discarded.

  #     > **Please note**: merchant **Software Services** should only accept a new order or update the status of an order after validating that the event has not been processed before.

  #     ### Acknowledgment Events

  #     When receiving new events, the **Software Service** should always send acknowledgement so that the **Ordering Application** does not send that same event again;

  #     >**Important recommendations**:
  #     >
  #     > Merchants **Software Service** should make an acknowledgment request for each polling request with results.  
  #     > If it receives events that are not used by the itself, it needs to send the acknowledgment of these events anyway so that it is not receiving them every polling again.   
  #     > **Open Delivery** recommends that this be the default treatment for all events not yet mapped in the **Software Service** application.  
  #     > **Software Services** only needs to send acknowledgment of the event once."

  # - name: ordersWebhook
  #   x-displayName: └───● Webhook (Optional)
  #   description: |-

  #     Receiving events via Webhook works as follows:

  #     <div align="center">
  #       <img src="https://abrasel-nacional.github.io/docs/images/webhook.png" />
  #     </div>

  #     ### Order Event Notification
  #     Webhook is sent to notify the merchant **Software Service** that an new order event has happened on the **Ordering Application**.

  #     The merchant **Software Service** that implements this webhook, should return an HTTP `200` response code with an empty response body to acknowledge receipt of the webhook event. 
  #     If the **Ordering Application** does not receive a `200` acknowledgement response, than the webhook event will be resent based on the **Ordering Application** policies.

  #     ### Webhook Headers
  #     **Open Delivery** will include security headers for all requests made to the merchant **Software Service** webhook URL.

  #     **Header Description**

  #     | Header            | Description |
  #     | ----------------- | ----------- |
  #     | X-App-Id          | An Unique Identificator of the **Ordering Application** |
  #     | X-App-MerchantId   | An Unique Identificator of the **Merchant** receiving the order |      
  #     | X-App-Signature   | SHA256 hash of the request body, using the client secret as the key |

        
  #     **Webhook Security** 

  #     Webhook messages are signed so that the merchant **Software Service** can verify that the sender is a valid **Ordering Application**. 
  #     Webhooks requests contain an X-App-Signature header. 
  #     The value of this field is a lowercased hexadecimal HMAC signature of the webhook HTTP request body, using the client secret as a key and SHA256 as the hash function.

  # - name: ordersDetails
  #   x-displayName: └───● Order Details
  #   description: |-

  #     Before confirming or canceling an order, it is necessary to get the order details so that the merchant **Software Service** user can check if he will be able to prepare and deliver this order, such as checking if he has all the necessary items and if he is available to make the delivery to the informed address.

  #     Through the GET /orders/{id} endpoint the merchant **Software Service** can get all the details of an order.

  #     This endpoint returns the code 200 and the content of the request. If an invalid request id or the id of an expired order is entered (depending on the **Ordering Application** policy) the endpoint returns 404.

  #     In this section you will find all the details of the payload of an order:

  #     <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/Order" />

  # - name: ordersStatus
  #   x-displayName: └───● Order Event Update
  #   description: |-

  #     Following the order lifecycle, the merchant **Software Service** needs to notify the **Ordering Application** of the upcoming order status.
       
  #     After acknowledging receipt of a new order event (either via polling or webhook) is expected that the **Software Service** explicitly 
  #     **POST [/orders/{orderId}/confirm](#operation/confirmOrder)** or **POST [/orders/{orderId}/requestCancellation](#operation/requestCancellation)** within a time window set by the **Ordering Application**.
  #     Otherwise the order can time out and auto-cancel and the merchant can suffer a penalty based on the **Ordering Application** policy.   
  #     Order acceptances should be posted as quickly as possible to minimize consumer cancellations.

  #     When the order is ready, it is expected that a request will be sent to **[/orders/{orderId}/readyForPickup](#operation/orderReady)**

  #     When the order goes out for Delivery, it is expected that a request will be sent to **[/orders/{orderId}/dispatch](#operation/dispatchOrder)**.

  #     > When sending requests to these endpoints, is expected that the **Ordering Application** notifies the consumer of the progress of the order.

  # - name: ordersCancellation
  #   x-displayName: └───● Order Cancellation
  #   description: |-

  #     An order can be canceled for several reasons and the initiative to cancel an order can come from the merchant, the customer, or the **Ordering Application**.   
  #     It may also happen that the delivery person requests the cancellation in some scenarios, such as when the customer is not found at the delivery address.

  #     > **Cancellation Rules**
  #     >  
  #     > It is expected that both the **Ordering Application** and merchant **Software Service** have their own order cancellation policies and inform their users.

  #     A cancellation request will always be an asynchronous processing, where one party makes a cancellation request and the other accepts or refuses it."

  #     A cancellation request must always contain:

  #     - **reason**: Open text field indicating the reason for the cancellation.
  #     - **code**: An enumerator containing a cancellation reason.  
  #     - **mode**: Field indicating whether the cancellation occurred Automatically or Manually.

  #     The cancellation can be requested by:

  #     ### **Software Service** (Merchant):

  #     <div align="center">
  #       <img src="https://abrasel-nacional.github.io/docs/images/software_cancel_request.png" />
  #     </div>

  #     If the merchant wants to cancel an order, it must make a **POST [/orders/{orderId}/requestCancellation](#operation/requestCancellation)** request.

  #     > **Penalties**
  #     >
  #     > Avoid order cancellations! Excessive cancellations can result in some penalties (depending on the **Ordering Application**'s** policy) such as having the merchant temporarily closed on the platform.

  #     **Cancellation Validation**

  #     The Cancellation request does not guarantee that the order is cancelled. When sending a request [/orders/{orderId}/requestCancellation](#operation/requestCancellation), the **Ordering Application** will send the code 202 (accepted) in response.
  #     This does not yet mean that the request has been cancelled. It means that the request has been accepted and will be processed by the **Ordering Application** cancellation service. As a result of this request, the merchant **Software Service** may receive at the next polling (or via webhook) one of the following events:

  #     - CANCELLATION_REQUEST_DENIED
  #     - CANCELLED

  #     The order should only be Canceled when the CANCELLED event is generated.

  #     > Cancellation rules may vary depending on the timing of the order (before or after confirmation). In some situations it is possible that the **Ordering Application** cancellation service will consult with the consumer on whether or not the consumer accepts the cancellation of the order.

  #     ``` 
  #     Cancellation codes:

  #     - SYSTEMIC_ISSUES
  #     - DUPLICATE_APPLICATION
  #     - UNAVAILABLE_ITEM
  #     - RESTAURANT_WITHOUT_DELIVERY_MAN
  #     - OUTDATED_MENU
  #     - ORDER_OUTSIDE_THE_DELIVERY_AREA
  #     - BLOCKED_CUSTOMER
  #     - OUTSIDE_DELIVERY_HOURS
  #     - INTERNAL_DIFFICULTIES_OF_THE_RESTAURANT
  #     - RISK_AREA
  #     ``` 

  #     > **Important**: It is recommended that the **Ordering Application** makes a new request on the [GET /v1/merchant](#operation/getMerchant) endpoint whenever a merchant makes a Cancellation request.

  #     ### **Ordering Application**

  #     <div align="center">
  #       <img src="https://abrasel-nacional.github.io/docs/images/orderingApp_cancel_request.png" />
  #     </div>

  #     Cancellation by **Ordering Application** can happen by:
  #     ```
  #     code: CONSUMER_CANCELLATION_REQUESTED
  #     ```  

  #     The consumer can request the cancellation of an order. 
  #     Depending on the cancellation rules applied, this option may not be enabled for all merchants. 
  #     It may also only be allowed at certain times, such as before the order is confirmed.
  #     ```
  #     code: OTHER_CANCELLATION_REASON
  #     ```

  #     Ordering Aplications may cancel the order for reasons other than via customer.

  #     **Cancellation Handshake**

  #     When the request occurs the merchant **Software Service** will receive an ORDER_CANCELLATION_REQUESTED event in polling (or via webhook) and must manifest itself through the following endpoints:

  #     **[/orders/{orderId}/acceptCancellation](#operation/cancellationAccepted)**  
  #     **[/orders/{orderId}/denyCancellation](#operation/cancellationDenied)**

  #     This request will be processed by the **Ordering Application**'s** cancellation service (asynchronously) and the merchant **Software Service** will receive in the next polling (or webhook) the following event(s):

  #     CANCELLATION_DENIED or CANCELLED

  #     Open Delivery provides a set of standards so that both merchants through their **Software Services** and **Ordering Applications** can request a new delivery to a logistics operator and track this delivery.

  #     ## Logistics API Usage

  #     Open Delivery's Logistic API aims to standardize the communication between a **requester** - which can be either a **Software Service** or an **Ordering Application** - and a company's software that provides **Logistic Services** (called here **Logistic Service**).  

  #     > A **Logistic Service** can be either a company that specializes in delivery services or an **Ordering Application** that also provides delivery services. 

  #     > The Open Delivery logistics API only handles communications between the merchant software (or **Ordering Application**) and the software of the logistics operator. Communications and interfaces with the deliverers at the end are not covered in this documentation, leaving it up to the logistics companies to perform this interaction.

  #     <div align="center">
  #       <img src="https://abrasel-nacional.github.io/docs/images/logisticsFlow.png" />
  #     </div>

  #     The endpoints provided here, cover the following functionalities:

  #     ### Delivery Order

  #     It covers the calling of a new delivery, as well as auxiliary endpoints for reporting the pickup of an order, the completion of the delivery, as well as problem handling and cancellations.

  #     ### Delivery Tracking
  #     Webhook to be available at the **requester's** side of the call, in order to receive all order event updates, as well as delivery information updates.

  #     ### Delivery Availability and Price

  #     Endpoint with the function of simulating a new delivery, with the purpose of checking if it is possible to make the delivery as well as its prices and times. "

  # - name: logisticOrder
  #   x-displayName: └───● Delivery Order
  #   description: |-

  #     ### Events

  #     This overview summarizes the **Open Delivery** delivery ordering flow and how it interacts with the requester (merchant **Software Services** or **Ordering Applications**) and the **Logistic Services**.

  #     <div align="center">
  #       <img src="https://abrasel-nacional.github.io/docs/images/logisticsOrderFlow.png" />
  #     </div>

  #     > The `PICKUP_ONGOING`, `DELIVERY_ONGOING` and `RETURNING_TO_MERCHANT` events are events that occur while the delivery person is on the move, so these events can be sent repeatedly in order to update the delivery person's location. The interval at which these events are sent is defined by each **Logistic Service**. 

  #     > It is important to emphasize that the entire event flow is per Order and even though a delivery may have combined orders (see section below), for all operations in the flow, the id to be used is the `orderId` (initially informed by the requester at the /logistics/delivery endpoint). 

  #      ### Combining Orders

  #     The Open Delivery logistics API offers the option of combining more than one order into a single delivery.  
  #     This can be done on both the **Software Service** (or **Ordering Application**) and the **Logistic Service** sides.

  #     To combine orders its necessary that at least one delivery is currently in progress.
  #     When requesting for a new delivery, you need to inform the `deliveryId` field of the ongoing delivery in the `combinedDeliveryId` field of the new request.

  #     <div align="center">
  #       <img src="https://abrasel-nacional.github.io/docs/images/logisticsCombined.png" />
  #     </div>

  #     > This combination will be subject to acceptance by the **Logistic Service**. 

  #     The **Logistic Service** may also perform order combination in its software, using its algorithms and processes (provided that the `canCombine` field is entered as `TRUE` in the delivery request). 
  #     > For this combination no action is required from the **requester**.

  #     Regardless of the case, the **Logistic Service** must inform in the event webhook the combined orders of the same merchant, through the `combinedOrdersIds` field.


  #     > Since all event flow is per Order, then in the case of deliveries that have combined orders, an event message must be sent to each of the orders separately. 

  #     ### Order Rejection and retries for the same order

  #     If a new delivery order is rejected by the **Logistic Service**, regardless of the reason, the **Software Service** / **Ordering Application** can make a new attempt for the same order (same `orderId` and same `orderDisplayId`). The **Logistic Service** must receive this retry only if the last sent event for this order was the `REJECTED` event. If any other event has already been sent, then the **Logistic Service** will return a duplicate orderId error.

  #     > The number of retries possible for the same order is defined by each **Logistic Service**.

  #     Receiving delivery events via Webhook works as follows:

  #      <div align="center">
  #        <img src="https://abrasel-nacional.github.io/docs/images/delivery_webhook.png" />
  #      </div>

  #      ### Delivery Order Event Notification
  #      Webhook is sent to notify the merchant **Software Service** (or the **Ordering Application**) that an new order event has happened on the **Logistic Service**.

  #      The host that implements this webhook, should return an HTTP `200` response code with an empty response body to acknowledge receipt of the webhook event. 
  #      If the **Logistic Service** does not receive a `200` acknowledgement response, than the webhook event will be resent based on the **Logistic Service** policies.

  #      ### Webhook Headers
  #      **Open Delivery** will include security headers for all requests made to the merchant **Software Service** webhook URL.

  #      **Header Description**

  #      | Header            | Description |
  #      | ----------------- | ----------- |
  #      | X-App-Id          | An Unique Identificator of the **Logistic Service** |
  #      | X-App-MerchantId  | An Unique Identificator of the **Merchant** receiving the order event |      
  #      | X-App-Signature   | SHA256 hash of the request body, using the client secret as the key |

         
  #      **Webhook Security** 

  #      Webhook messages are signed so that the merchant **Software Service** (or the **Ordering Application**) can verify that the sender is a valid **Logistic Service**. 
  #      Webhooks requests contain an X-App-Signature header. 
  #      The value of this field is a lowercased hexadecimal HMAC signature of the webhook HTTP request body, using the client secret as a key and SHA256 as the hash function.

    x-displayName: └───● Overview
    description: |-

      Open Delivery is providing a way to standardize the information that is being or was negotiated between the Merchant and the Ordering Application through a set of standard fields, called Contract Summary Sheet.

      The idea is that whenever necessary, the Ordering Application will be able to provide the Merchant with the Contract Summary Sheet so that the Merchant is aware of all the information related to the contract, such as Fees, Payment Information, Contract Duration, and Registration and Contact Information of the parties. 

      The template for the Contract Summary Sheet is provided below and can be downloaded and used by Ordering Applications.

      <div align="center">
        <a href="https://abrasel-nacional.github.io/docs/files/contractSummary_ptbr.docx">Download Contract Summary Sheet Template</a>
      </div>

      The Contract Summary Sheet can also be accessed through the endpoint described below.

    description: |-

      Besides standardizing the Contract Summary Sheet, Open Delivery is proposing, through some standard APIs, a way for the Software Services, partnering with Ordering Applications, to create a Hiring Service.

      Through a sequence of steps, the Software Service can display on its platform, information regarding plans and proposals from several Ordering Applications, so that its merchants can compare these rates and plans and choose the one they want to work with.

      The Software Services can then send this contracting intention to the Ordering Applications, facilitating the contract signature and onboarding of these merchants.

      Below are the steps to implement this contracting environment:


      <div align="center">
        <img src="https://abrasel-nacional.github.io/docs/images/signUpService.png" />
      </div>

      **1 -** The Software Services and Ordering Application shall contact each other, to partner so that the Software plataform can access and display its plans and rates, and send contracting intentions. The Software Service should also receive a set of credentials with access to the APIs of this Sign-Up Service.

      **2 -** With the credentials in hand, the Software Service makes a request to the GET endpoint /signup/contractConditions, informing some initial merchant data.  
      The Ordering Application returns a set of plans and rates to the Software Service.

      The Software Service should use this response to display to the Merchant, all the information returned, so that the Merchant has a clear view of everything being offered.

      **3 -** After the Merchant has analyzed and compared the rates and plans, it may indicate an intention to contract with one or more Ordering Applications that the Software Service has partnered with. The Software Service then sends the chosen plans to the Ordering Application, via the POST endpoint /signup/chosenConditions.  
      In response the Software Service will receive a contract ID and instructions for the Merchant to sign the contract (or term of service).

      **4 -** Merchant performs the signing of the contract or term (in an environment external to the Software Service).

      **5 -** Software Service checks the contract Status and conditions through the GET /signup/contractStatus endpoint. It is through this endpoint that the Software will know when the signing has occurred and whether the contracting process is proceeding successfully or not.

      **6 -** Software Service performs the onboarding of the complementary registration information through the PUT /signup/merchantAccount endpoint.

      **7 -** Contract between Merchant and Ordering Application becomes active, and both parties can now send and receive orders.

        It is important that the **Logistic Service** always informs the **Software Service** (or **Ordering Application**) of a problem (via webhook), even if the problem does not require any action by the merchant to solve it.

        > Since there are other ways to solve delivery problems, such as via telephone or messaging applications, the implementation of this endpoint is optional, and the **Logistic Service** will inform the **Software Service** (or **Ordering Application**) of the need to use it.

        Information about a update in the systems.

        This endpoint can be used in the following ways:

        **1 - Sent with an empty body:**  
        This will force **Ordering Application** to make a new request to the **[GET /merchant](#operation/getMerchant)** endpoint to update all the **merchant** information.

        **2 - Sent with only the `merchantStatus` field:**  
        This will force the opening or closing of the **merchant** within the **Ordering Application**, without forcing a new **[GET /merchant](#operation/getMerchant)** call.

        **3 - Sent only with the `entityType` and `updatedObjects` fields:**  
        This will force the **Ordering Application** to update only the sent objects, without forcing a new **[GET /merchant](#operation/getMerchant)** call.
        > When the `entityType` field is populated, the `updatedObjects` field cannot be empty.

        **4 - Sent the `merchantStatus`, `entityType` and `updatedObjects` fields:**  
        This will force scenarios 2 and 3 to happen simultaneously.

        The creation and content of the key is of responsibility of the endpoint's host.

        As of the time of this release only one scope will be used for all endpoints: `od.all`.

        ### Generating a Client Credentials Token

        To generate a client credentials token, the merchant **Software Service** must retrieve the **clientId** and **clientSecret** from a **Ordering Application** Company and access the [/oauth/token](#operation/getToken) endpoint.

        > The **Ordering Application** MUST provide one `clientId` and `clientSecret` credentials for each individual merchant it will work with, even if these merchants use the same **Software Service**.

        ### Usage

        The **accessToken** field will contain the token used to authenticate against the **Open Delivery** APIs. Once you’ve obtained this token, you can provide it in the “Authorization” header of requests you make to endpoints that require client credentials scopes.

        The **expiresIn** field indicates the lifetime of the access token, provided in seconds. This should be cached and re-used across requests until (or shortly before) expiration, not re-generated per request.

        ```

        curl \n
        -H 'authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' \n
        https://{baseURL}/v1/events:polling

        ```

        > Refresh Token is not available at this version."
